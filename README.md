## Features
 *  Passport: This module lets you authenticate using a username and password in your Node.js applications. By plugging into Passport, local authentication can be easily and unobtrusively integrated into any application or framework that supports Connect-style middleware, including Express. <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport-local">Read More Here</a>.
 * EJS Templating Engine: Based on user request on the earlier release of the boiler plate, sompe told me that the prefer EJS to PUG, which I initially used as the template engine. Therefore I used EJS this time, to serve as the app's view template engine.
